# Tapioca
## An portable, lightweight editor in nearly strict posix shell and non-GNU coreutils

## Intro
Tapioca is built to be as portable as possible out of the box, without sacrificing usability.

It was built to fill a space that doesn't really exist currently, in that there are two core concepts it fulfils:
 - The most portable software is interpreted, as it will then run on any architechture or standard implementation
 - The closest thing to a standard "interpreter" in posix sh

The best performance I have found comes from running under busybox ash
## Basic keybinds
