# Tapioca
## An portable, lightweight editor in nearly strict posix shell

## Intro
	Tapioca is built to be as portable as possible out of the box, without sacrificing usability.
	It was built to fill a space that doesn't really exist currently, in that there are two core concepts it fulfils:
	 - The most portable software is interpreted, as it will then run on any architechture or standard implementation
	 - The closest thing to a standard "interpreter" in posix sh
